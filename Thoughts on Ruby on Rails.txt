Thoughts on Ruby on Rails:

- That file and folder structure created by "rails new" may be nice but it makes me
  wonder... "Why do I need all this for an application that does nothing?  Why can't
  my application simply use all this stuff as defaults and then build on it and
  adapt it?"

- The scaffolding/generation hints at a lot of boilerplate code being necessary.  If
  code is simple and concise, it should never require auto-generation.
